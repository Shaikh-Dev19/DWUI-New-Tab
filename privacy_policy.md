# Privacy Policy
_Last Updated: April 18, 2025_

**DWUI – A Modern New Tab Extension** ("DWUI", "we", "our", or "us") values your privacy. This Privacy Policy outlines how we handle your information when you use our browser extension.

---

## 1. Information We Collect

DWUI **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal or sensitive user data**. All user preferences—such as selected backgrounds, shortcuts, and UI configurations—are stored **locally within your browser** and are never sent to external servers.

---

## 2. Permissions & Data Usage

DWUI may request the following browser permissions to function properly:

- **Host Permissions** – Used to fetch website favicons from `https://www.google.com/s2/favicons`.
- **Omnibox** – Allows you to quickly search via the browser's address bar using the `dw` keyword.

> **No data is shared, transmitted, or collected for analytics or third-party use.**

---

## 3. Third-Party Services

DWUI does **not** use any third-party analytics, tracking, or advertising services. However, if you create custom shortcuts to external websites, those sites may collect data per their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies separately.

---

## 4. Data Security

Since all extension data is stored locally and never transmitted, the risk of data leakage or unauthorized access is minimized. DWUI does not create or maintain any external server infrastructure.

---

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, the revised version will be posted with an updated “Last Updated” date. Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the new terms.
